    "content": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Over the past year, there has been quite an increase in cyber security trends and emerging risks.This has been contributed with the rise in the adoption of advanced technologies and work from home setup. Organizations are finding it harder to detect, respond to and prevent attacks effectively because of skill shortage.</p><h3>Body</h3><p>Cybersecurity trends are basically the patterns, techniques and threat vectors that have emerged due to advancement in technology and innovation by adversaries. Threats are potential to cause harm. Some of the threats and trends in the past year are;</p><ol><li><strong>AI Driven Cyber-attacks:</strong> AI has been adopted across many industries bringing significant benefits and challenges too. Unfortunately, it is being used by Cyber criminals to enhance their attacks. Hackers are employing AI to orchestrate sophisticated attacks via bots.</li><li><strong>Insider threats:</strong> This are on the rise due to many people working from home; hence many endpoints are exposed. The average of insider threats is high about $17.8 million dollars in 2025. This is a serious wake up call. To reduce threats here,companies will need to have stricter policies for handling and sharing sensitive data, tools to flag unusual behaviors and educating team members.</li><li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong>Attackers target vendors or 3rd party software’s, they can compromise many downstream organizations at once. An example was the one incident with SolarWinds which is used by many organizations. With one single update all of them were compromised.</li><li><strong>Social Engineering with deepfakes:</strong> Threat actors are now creating realistic videos, clips and images. The results are too convincing to spread false information quickly.</li><li><strong>Quantum threat:</strong> Quantum computing has the potential to break contemporary encryption. Businesses and governments should plan for that shift and adopt quantum-resistant cryptography to avoid major disruption later.</li><li><strong>IoT Vulnerabilities:</strong>Many IoT devices are targeted by attackers because they lack strong security features, often shipping with default passwords, outdated firmware or unencrypted communication channels. The limited computing power of IoT devices makes it hard to install advanced security tools.</li><li><strong>Skills Gap:</strong>The cybersecurity industry is facing a significant skills gap with demand for qualified professionals far outpacing supply. With the rising cyber-attacks scale and complexity, companies are struggling to find the necessary technical skills needed.</li><li><strong>Ransomware:</strong>It is still one of the most aggressive threats causing financial and data loses. Ransomware groups are turning into service providers, providing affiliates with easy-to-use toolkits for profits.</li><li><strong>Zero Trust Architecture:</strong>The the principle of “never trust, always verify”. By 2026, 81% of organizations plan to implement zero trust. Many organizations are adopting micro-segmentation, user context checks and continuous session monitoring.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, companies must keep up with security trends and implement the necessary solution.Protecting digital assets calls for for a strategic combination of tools, training and resilience planning.</p>"
