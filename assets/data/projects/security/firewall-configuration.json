  "objective": "Create a PowerShell script that detects whether Windows Firewall is enabled on local or remote machines, enables it if disabled and confirms the firewall state.",
  "steps": [
    "Configured VirtualBox VMs with Host-Only networking",
    "Verified connectivity using ping and assign valid IP addresses",
    "Run winrm quickconfig on each VM to configure WinRM service, listener and firewall rules",
    "Changed network profile to Private to allow WinRM firewall exceptions",
    "Enabled PowerShell Remoting on VMs using Enable-PSRemoting -Force",
    "Started WinRM service and verify listener with Test-WsMan localhost",
    "Configured TrustedHosts on host to include VM IPs",
    "Tested remote connectivity with Invoke-Command and Get-Credential",
    "Checked firewall status using 'Get-NetFirewallProfile' or 'netsh advfirewall show allprofiles'",
    "Disabled firewall in one virtual machine using 'Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain, Private,Public -Enabled False' or 'netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on'  to create a vulnerable machine",
    "Automatically checked and enabled firewall if disabled using firewall_check.ps1 script"
  ],
  "results":"Successfully checked and enabled firewall on host machine and connected to remote machines using PowerShell Remoting, detected firewall status accurately and enabled firewall where needed",
