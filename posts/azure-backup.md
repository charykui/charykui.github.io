        # Learning Azure Backup

        I set up Azure Backup to protect a test VM and configured retention policies.

**Steps taken:**
- Created Recovery Services vault
- Configured backup policy
- Performed initial backup

**Lessons learned:**
- Backups need testing; restore verification is crucial.
